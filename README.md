Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a Multimodal RAG System designed for information retrieval and summarization using various data modalities, including text, PDFs, and tables.

Features
Text and Table Processing:
Extracts text and tables from PDF documents.
Summarizes content for easier understanding.
Query Handling:
Handles complex queries, including financial metrics (e.g., EV/NTM, revenue growth).
Retrieves relevant information based on context.
Integration:
Utilizes APIs and libraries for retrieval and summarization.
Supports multimodal data such as images and financial data.
Dependencies
      
Install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install langchain unstructured[all-docs] pydantic lxml openai chromadb tiktoken pytesseract langchain-community pdf2image langchain-chroma langchain-experimental
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nishanth19042003/MultiModel-RAG-Using-Langchain.git
cd multimodal-rag
Install dependencies as described above.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook and update file paths for your dataset.

Usage
Data Preparation
Place the target PDF file in the specified path.
Update the file path and name in the code:
python
Copy code
fpath = "/content/drive/MyDrive/cj/"
fname = "cj.pdf"
Query Examples
Example financial queries include:
"Give me company names that are interesting investments based on EV / NTM and NTM revenue growth."
"What are the EV / NTM and NTM revenue growth for MongoDB, Cloudflare, and Datadog?"
Output
Retrieves summaries, financial metrics, and visualizations for multimodal data.
System Components
PDF Data Extraction: Uses tools like unstructured.partition.pdf for extracting text and tables.
Query Execution: Leverages LangChain for query processing and multimodal retrieval.
API Integration: Supports APIs for advanced financial queries and data fetching.
Future Enhancements
Extend support for additional data modalities.
Improve summarization and query resolution for large datasets.
